QUESTION 2
What is the core problem blockchain is trying to solve?
ANS:The problems Block Chain trying to solve are as follows :
1.Authencity of data
2.Security
3.Need third part trust
QUESTION 3
What are the few features blockchain will give you?
ANS: The features of Block Chain Technology are as follows:

2.Immutable
3.Tamper Proof
4.Unchangeable
QUESTION 4
What all things does a block contain?
A block contains:
1. Block number
2. Transaction Record
3. Previous Digital Signature
4. Mining Key
QUESTION 5:
How is the verifiabilty of blockchain has been attained?
BlockChain is a distributed database, if any change is made to a block, change will be reflected in others blocks too because the fingerprints will also change. So change can easily be tracked and hence verification can be attained.
PREVIOUS FINGERPRINT+NEW DATA =CURRENT FINGERPRINT.
